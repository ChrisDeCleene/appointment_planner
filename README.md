# React Appointment Planner
> The focus of this project was to showcase what I have learned in React including react-router and function component state to create a front end appointment planner. I built this as part of the Full Stack Engineer Career Path on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn). Please share any feedback regarding this project! Happy coding!
